# Meta Studio

This folder contains materials for developing KaleidoSphere itself.

Key notes:
- The project knowledge base (instance context) lives in `docs/project-shared/`.
- System development should follow the baseline KaleidoSphere workflow.
- The development flow should reference `docs/start.md`.
- Contribution rules remain in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Self-dev entry points:
- `meta-studio/self-dev/development/README.md`
- `meta-studio/self-dev/tests/README.md`
